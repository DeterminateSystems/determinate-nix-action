# Ô∏è‚ùÑÔ∏è Determinate Nix Action

[Determinate] is the best way to use Nix on macOS, WSL, and Linux.
It is an end-to-end toolchain for using Nix, from installation to collaboration to deployment.

Based on the [Determinate Nix Installer][nix-installer] and its corresponding [Nix Installer Action][nix-installer-action], responsible for over tens of thousands of Nix installs daily.

> [!NOTE]
>
> **Why a different Action?**
>
> We created a new Action to synchronize version tags to [Determinate Nix][det-nix] releases.
> GitHub Actions are tagged with the specific version, like `v3.5.2`, with a moving `v3` tag for the major version.
> We needed a fresh tag namespace since `nix-installer-action` already has a `v3` tag.

## ü´∂ Platform support

- ‚ö° **Accelerated KVM** on open source projects and larger runners. See [GitHub's announcement](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-02-23-hardware-accelerated-android-virtualization-on-actions-windows-and-linux-larger-hosted-runners/) for more info.
- üêß Linux, x86_64, aarch64, and i686
- üçè macOS, x86_64 and aarch64
- ü™ü WSL2, x86_64 and aarch64
- üêã Containers, ARC, and Act
- üêô GitHub Enterprise Server
- üíÅ GitHub Hosted, self-hosted, and long running Actions Runners

## Ô∏èüîß Usage

Here's an example Actions workflow configuration that uses `determinate-nix-action`:

```yaml
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  build-pkg:
    name: Build Nix package
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5.0.0
      - uses: DeterminateSystems/determinate-nix-action@main # or v3.9.1 to pin to a release
      - run: nix build .
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you use [FlakeHub], you need to add a `permissions` block like the one in the example above or else Determinate Nix can't authenticate with FlakeHub or [FlakeHub Cache][cache].

## üìå Version pinning: lock it down!

### Why pin your Action?

Unlike `DeterminateSystems/nix-installer-action`, we fully support explicit version pinning for maximum consistency.
This Action is **automatically tagged** for every Determinate Nix release, giving you complete control over your CI environment:

üìç Pinning to `DeterminateSystems/determinate-nix-action@v3.9.1` guarantees:

- Same `nix-installer-action` revision every time
- Consistent Determinate Nix v3.9.1 installation
- Reproducible CI workflows, even years later

‚ú® Using `@main` instead? You'll:

- Always get the latest Determinate Nix release
- Occasionally participate in phased rollouts (helping us test new releases!)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Set up [Dependabot] to stay current with Determinate Nix releases without sacrificing stability.

### ü§ñ Automate updates with Dependabot

Keep your GitHub Actions fresh without manual work! Create `.github/dependabot.yml` with:

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: github-actions
    directory: /
    schedule:
      interval: weekly
```
